# Physics_DTU

This repo collects my notes, notebooks, and reference material for the DTU General Engineering physics courses.

The goal is to build a compact, code-backed companion to the official textbooks, with worked examples, quick simulations, and short conceptual summaries for each topic.

Content is organized by semester and theme (e.g. mechanics, E&M, thermodynamics), mostly as Jupyter notebooks plus a few supporting PDFs and scripts.

Use anything here at your own risk and double‑check against the course notes and OpenStax/DTU material; this is a living student resource, not an official solution manual.

Feel free to clone, adapt, and extend for your own study workflow, but keep academic integrity in mind when using this alongside assignments and exams.
