#Problem_1

1. Wolf not moving:
Velocity is zero where the graph crosses the time axis, 
i.e. at points A, E, and H → first question: option B.

2. Wolf not accelerating:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, 
so it is zero where the graph has a horizontal tangent (local maximum or minimum), 
i.e. at C and F → second question: option C.

3. Constant-acceleration intervals:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, so it is (approximately) constant 
where the graph is nearly a straight line. 
That occurs in segments D–E and G–H, so first question: option C.

4. Time of greatest distance from start:
Displacement is maximal when velocity crosses zero going from positive to negative, 
since position increases while v>0 and then decreases when v<0. 
That happens at E, so second question: option B.

#Problem_2

With equal time intervals between dots, the distance between successive dots is proportional 
to the particle’s average velocity during that interval Δx∝vΔt with constant Δt.
Increasing spacing ⇒ speeding up; constant spacing ⇒ constant speed; decreasing spacing ⇒ slowing down.
Apply to the dot pattern
From left to right:
(Left) The particle starts from rest, and the first few spacings 
gradually increase → speed increasing (positive acceleration).
(Middle) Several spacings are roughly the same → speed approximately constant (zero acceleration).
(Right) Spacings become smaller → the particle is slowing down while still moving right (negative acceleration).
This time history of speeding up, then constant speed, then slowing down matches graph A: velocity rises linearly 
from zero, is constant for a while, then decreases linearly back toward zero. 
Graph B would give a smooth speed-up then smooth slow-down with no flat constant-velocity segment, 
and graph C never has a slowing-down phase.
Therefore, the graph that fits the motion is A.

#Problem_3

On a position–time graph, the instantaneous speed is the slope of the curve; a decreasing slope means the 
speed is decreasing. Between A→C the slope is getting steeper with time, so the car is speeding up, 
not slowing down. Around D and E the curve is still rising (car moving forward) but the slope is 
getting smaller and tends toward zero, which means the forward velocity is decreasing, 
i.e. the car is slowing down there.

The car is slowing down at points D and E.
