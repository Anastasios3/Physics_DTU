#Problem_1

1. Wolf not moving:
Velocity is zero where the graph crosses the time axis, 
i.e. at points A, E, and H → first question: option B.

2. Wolf not accelerating:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, 
so it is zero where the graph has a horizontal tangent (local maximum or minimum), 
i.e. at C and F → second question: option C.

3. Constant-acceleration intervals:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, so it is (approximately) constant 
where the graph is nearly a straight line. 
That occurs in segments D–E and G–H, so first question: option C.

4. Time of greatest distance from start:
Displacement is maximal when velocity crosses zero going from positive to negative, 
since position increases while v>0 and then decreases when v<0. 
That happens at E, so second question: option B.
