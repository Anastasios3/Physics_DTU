#Problem_1

1. Wolf not moving:
Velocity is zero where the graph crosses the time axis, 
i.e. at points A, E, and H → first question: option B.

2. Wolf not accelerating:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, 
so it is zero where the graph has a horizontal tangent (local maximum or minimum), 
i.e. at C and F → second question: option C.

3. Constant-acceleration intervals:
Acceleration is the slope of the velocity–time graph, so it is (approximately) constant 
where the graph is nearly a straight line. 
That occurs in segments D–E and G–H, so first question: option C.

4. Time of greatest distance from start:
Displacement is maximal when velocity crosses zero going from positive to negative, 
since position increases while v>0 and then decreases when v<0. 
That happens at E, so second question: option B.

#Problem_2

With equal time intervals between dots, the distance between successive dots is proportional 
to the particle’s average velocity during that interval Δx∝vΔt with constant Δt.
Increasing spacing ⇒ speeding up; constant spacing ⇒ constant speed; decreasing spacing ⇒ slowing down.
Apply to the dot pattern
From left to right:
(Left) The particle starts from rest, and the first few spacings 
gradually increase → speed increasing (positive acceleration).
(Middle) Several spacings are roughly the same → speed approximately constant (zero acceleration).
(Right) Spacings become smaller → the particle is slowing down while still moving right (negative acceleration).
This time history of speeding up, then constant speed, then slowing down matches graph A: velocity rises linearly 
from zero, is constant for a while, then decreases linearly back toward zero. 
Graph B would give a smooth speed-up then smooth slow-down with no flat constant-velocity segment, 
and graph C never has a slowing-down phase.
Therefore, the graph that fits the motion is A.

#Problem_3

On a position–time graph, the instantaneous speed is the slope of the curve; a decreasing slope means the 
speed is decreasing. Between A→C the slope is getting steeper with time, so the car is speeding up, 
not slowing down. Around D and E the curve is still rising (car moving forward) but the slope is 
getting smaller and tends toward zero, which means the forward velocity is decreasing, 
i.e. the car is slowing down there.

The car is slowing down at points D and E.

#Problem_4

Problem: Two cars braking head-on

Data:
- Maximum braking acceleration magnitude: a = 8 m/s^2 (each car, opposite to its motion)
- Speed of each car: v0 = 88 km/h = 24.44 m/s
- Initial distance between cars: L = 85 m

Key kinematic formulas (constant acceleration):
1) v = v0 + a t
2) v^2 = v0^2 + 2 a Δx

--------------------------------------------------
a) Do the cars crash?

Stopping distance for one car:

0 = v0^2 + 2 a Δx
=> Δx = v0^2 / (2 |a|)
   = 24.44^2 / (2 * 8)
   ≈ 37.3 m

Both cars together need distance:
2 Δx ≈ 2 * 37.3 m ≈ 74.6 m

Since 74.6 m < 85 m, they stop before meeting.
Conclusion for (a): No, the cars do not crash.

--------------------------------------------------
Stopping time (used below):

0 = v0 + a t_stop
=> t_stop = v0 / |a|
          = 24.44 / 8
          ≈ 3.06 s

--------------------------------------------------
b) Relative velocity in a crash

There is no crash, so their relative velocity at impact is not defined (they never meet).

--------------------------------------------------
c) Distance between the cars after stopping

Remaining separation:

d_final = L − 2 Δx
        = 85 m − 2 * 37.3 m
        ≈ 85 m − 74.6 m
        ≈ 10.4 m

So after stopping they are about 10 m apart.

--------------------------------------------------
d) Position as function of time (for sketch)

Choose x-axis along the road.
Let x = 0 be the initial position of the left car.
Positive x points to the right.

Car 1 (left car):
- Initial position: x1(0) = 0
- Initial velocity: v0 (to the right)
- Acceleration: −a  (since it brakes)

For 0 ≤ t ≤ t_stop:
x1(t) = v0 t − (1/2) a t^2

After t_stop:
x1(t) = x1(t_stop) = Δx ≈ 37.3 m (constant)

Car 2 (right car):
- Initial position: x2(0) = 85 m
- Initial velocity: −v0 (to the left)
- Acceleration: +a  (opposite its motion)

For 0 ≤ t ≤ t_stop:
x2(t) = 85 m − v0 t + (1/2) a t^2

After t_stop:
x2(t) = x2(t_stop) = 85 m − Δx ≈ 47.7 m (constant)

Check at t = t_stop ≈ 3.06 s:
- x1 ≈ 37.3 m
- x2 ≈ 47.7 m
Gap ≈ 10.4 m (same as in part c).

To sketch: 
--- ( 01_spring_semester/01_st_week/Problem4Graph.png )

- Plot x1(t) and x2(t) versus t on the same axes.
- Both start as concave-down parabolas moving toward each other.
- Slopes go to zero at t ≈ 3.06 s.
- After that time both curves are horizontal, separated by ≈ 10 m.

#Problem_5

Correct multiple‑choice answers: B and H.

Result:
- The cars do NOT crash.
- They are both standing still after 2.78 s.
- When they have stopped, they are 61.4 m apart.

Key calculations (rounded):
Initial speed of each car: v0 = 50.0 km/h = 13.9 m/s.
Deceleration of each car: a = 5.00 m/s^2.

Time for one car to stop:
  t_stop = v0 / a = 13.9 / 5.00 = 2.78 s.

Stopping distance of one car:
  s = v0^2 / (2 a) = 13.9^2 / (2 * 5.00) = 19.3 m.

Total distance closed by both cars before they stop:
  s_total = 2 * 19.3 m = 38.6 m.

Initial separation: 100 m.
Separation when both have stopped:
  d_final = 100 m - 38.6 m = 61.4 m.

Crash check using relative motion:
  relative speed v_rel = 2 * 13.9 = 27.8 m/s.
  relative deceleration a_rel = 2 * 5.00 = 10.0 m/s^2.
  relative stopping distance s_rel = v_rel^2 / (2 a_rel) = 38.6 m < 100 m.

Therefore the cars never reach each other and all crash answers are wrong,
while B (61.4 m apart) and H (2.78 s to stand still) are correct.
